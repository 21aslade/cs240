# Programming Exam Review

üñ•Ô∏è [Lecture Video](#videos)

This programming exam is a re-creation of your [chess phase-0](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/chess/0-chess-moves/chess-moves.md) assignment, but under time constraints and without TA support.

You will take the exam as a Canvas quiz and will have 4 hours to complete the exam and answer the quiz questions, which consist mostly of uploading code and screenshots to demonstrate your work.

The exam is pass/fail.

You will use Examity to record both video and audio while taking the exam.

## Examity Exam Requirements
You must meet the following requirements for taking Examity exams:

- Have a [supported device](https://www.examity.com/test-taker-systems-requirements/). Note that Examity does not support Linux devices.
- Have a relatively new version of the Chrome web browser (other browsers will not work)
- Have only one monitor attached to your computer (if you have additional monitors, you will need to unplug them)
- Have a working video camera and microphone
- Have a reliable Internet connection

## Preparation
To prepare for your exam, we recommend that you first review your chess phase-0 solution to see if there are ways to simplify it while still passing all of the tests. Then study your code to make sure you understand all of it. Finally, practice taking the exam under exam conditions until you are completing the programming part of the exam in about 3 1/2 hours or less.

## Pre Exam Setup
Before taking the exam you should complete all of the steps in the chess phase-0 [getting started](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/chess/0-chess-moves/getting-started.md) document, except you will not put the project in a GitHub repo. Just create a folder and setup it up with the starter code and open it in Intellij. This will mean you will have an Intellij project with the provided starter code and tests setup and compiling.

You should also open the Javadoc in a web browser tab and the [chess phase-0 specification](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/chess/0-chess-moves/chess-moves.md) in another browser tab.

You may not open other tabs or access other information during the exam except for one page of notes as described below.

## Notes
You may use one page of notes (both sides of the page if you want). If you use notes, you must submit them to the Programming Exam Notes assignment on Canvas and then get on the help queue so a TA can review your notes with you.

You are limited in what you can include in your notes. You may not include exam specific information in your notes, such as code, steps for completing the exam, etc. The types of things you can include are information from the API documentation, such as a list of methods from a particular class.

## Available Resources
There are two practice quizzes available to help you prepare for the exam. First, there is an Examity setup quiz. You should take this before starting the exam to ensure that you have Examity setup properly.

Second, there is a practice programming exam. This is an exact copy of the exam. You should review this so you are familiar with the structure and format of the exam, and with the questions you will need to respond to to demonstrate that you completed the exam.

The practice quizzes and the actual programming exams (one for each of the three attempts) are available on Canvas in the "Programming Exam" section of the "Assignments" tab.

## Warnings and Other Information
Once you start the exam, do not close any web browser tabs. Sometimes closing a tab causes Examity to terminate the exam.

You may take the exam at any time during the exam period. Just make sure you give yourself enough time to complete the exam by the end of the exam period. However, we recommend taking it during TA hours. TAs will not be able to help you with programming or debugging during the exam, however, sometimes they can help with Examity or other issues that occur during the exam, but only if you take it during their office hours.

Because of the length of the exam, you are allowed to leave to use the restroom during the exam. However, this will cause you to be flagged by Examity. If you leave to use the restroom please tell the camera when you return that you did not look at any exam related materials or receive any exam help or support while you were gone.

## Exam Retakes
You must pass the programming exam to pass the class. The exam is pass/fail. You will either receive 100% or 0%. You may take the exam up to three times for reduced credit each time (see Canvas for the percentage of your total grade and the maximum score for each take of the exam).

If you do not pass the exam by the third attempt, it will not be possible for you to pass the class. In that case you should withdraw.

The first retake starts the day after the end of the original exam period ends. You will either see a score in Canvas (telling you that you passed the exam) or you will receive an email from a TA telling you why you did not pass the exam, by the end of the day on the day the original exam is due. There are multiple gradebook items for the exam (one for each of the three attempts and one one labeled "Programming Exam (gradebook item)"). The one labeled "Programming Exam (gradebook item)" is the one that will contain your score when you pass the exam. The others can be ignored.

You are required to meet with your instructor before your final attempt if you do not pass the exam by the end of the first retake. The purpose of the meeting will be for your instructor to help you prepare to pass the exam on your final attempt. You are responsible for contacting your instructor to schedule this meeting.
